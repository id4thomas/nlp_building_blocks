	* Available: may be in use at the moment, but system can reclaim when needed
		* cached memory that can be freed

		* "though the program freed memory , but it does not return to system immidiately instead, it is kept in the application for reuse. when the program terminated, the memory then return to system."
		* "Over a certain chunk size (which I think is hard wired inside malloc) memory is returned as soon as it is freed."
	* guarantee that when memory is freed OS will reclaim?

		* "If you program to a Posix target, you might want to use mmap() directly instead of malloc to guarantee that the memory is returned to the system once deallocated with munmap()"
