## Using Influence Functions to interpret training data influence
* Tracing Model Outputs to the Training Data

	* Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions

* influence: if a copy of a given training example were added to the dataset, how would that change the trained parameters
	* use inverse-Hessian-vector product, gradients of all candidate training examples
	* interesting phenomena emerges in large sizes

* below math example
	* small models are influenced by unrelated sequence
	* large model influence explains the reasoning

* below crosslingual example
	* large models show strong cross-lingual influence
		* korean is considerably influenced by English sequence in large models
