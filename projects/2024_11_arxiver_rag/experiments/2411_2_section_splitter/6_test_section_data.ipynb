It follows from Khanevsky's result that (\\\\#(L\\\\\\\\cap L\\\\_{n})\\\\\\\\xrightarrow{n\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\infty). In contrast to Hofer's metric (d\\\\_{H}), the spectral distance (\\\\\\\\gamma) is bounded \\\\[14]. Therefore, Corollary 1\\\\.2 shows that the number of bars in (\\\\\\\\mathcal{B}(L,L\\\\_{n})) tends to (\\\\\\\\infty).

Let (L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}(L\\\\_{0})) be two transverse Lagrangians that intersect in (2n) points. The action spectrum ({\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q)\\\\|q\\\\\\\\in L\\\\\\\\cap L^{\\\\\\\\prime}}) coincides with the endpoints of the bars in (\\\\\\\\mathcal{B}(L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime})). Therefore, the barcode (\\\\\\\\mathcal{B}(L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime})) consists of (n\\\\-1\\\\) finite bars and two infinite bars. We prove the Theorem by induction on the number of intersection points.\\n\\n*Base case:* If there are only two intersection points, say (q) and (p), then Hofer's distance is equal to the area of one of the Floer strips connecting (q) and (p). This is also the difference between the action values of the two infinite bars in (\\\\\\\\mathcal{B}(L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime})), hence (d\\\\_{H}(L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=\\\\\\\\gamma(L,L^{\\\\\\\\prime})).\\n\\n*Base case:**Induction Step:* Suppose that Theorem 1\\\\.1 holds for Lagrangians intersecting transversely in (2(n\\\\-1\\\\)) points.

We assume that any two intersection points (q\\\\\\\\neq p\\\\\\\\in L\\\\\\\\cap L^{\\\\\\\\prime}) satisfy (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q)\\\\\\\\neq\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(p)). In order to use the induction hypothesis, we construct a Lagrangian (L^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime}) using Khanevsky's construction for *deleting a leaf*\\\\[16]. A *leaf* is a connected component of (\\\\\\\\Sigma\\\\\\\\backslash(L\\\\\\\\cup L^{\\\\\\\\prime})), which is bounded by one connected component of (L^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\backslash L) and one connected component of (L\\\\\\\\backslash L^{\\\\\\\\prime}).

Figure 5 shows an example of (T(L)).\\n\\nThe graph consists of two connected components corresponding to the two regions of (\\\\\\\\Sigma\\\\\\\\backslash L). For each of these connected components, the vertex corresponding to the unbounded region is set to be the root. Thus each connected component is a rooted tree.

It has corners at two neighboured intersection points. In the language of combinatorial Floer theory, this region corresponds to a minimal smooth lune (v\\\\\\\\colon\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\\\\\longrightarrow\\\\\\\\Sigma) for ((L\\\\_{0},L)), in the sense that there is no smooth lune (u\\\\\\\\colon\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\\\\\longrightarrow\\\\\\\\Sigma) with (\\\\\\\\operatorname{Im}(u)\\\\\\\\subsetneq\\\\\\\\operatorname{Im}(v)).

Then the set of intersection points of (L\\\\_{0}) and (L^{\\\\\\\\prime}) is (P^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\=P\\\\\\\\setminus{\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}}) and we denote the Floer complex of the pair ((L\\\\_{0},L^{\\\\\\\\prime})) by (C^{\\\\\\\\prime}:\\\\=\\\\\\\\operatorname{CF}(L\\\\_{0},L^{\\\\\\\\prime})). Following \\\\[1, Appendix C] the chain complex (C^{\\\\\\\\prime}) can be expressed in terms of (C) as follows. Recall that the differentials in (C) and (C^{\\\\\\\\prime}) are given by the formulas\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\partial(q)\\\\=\\\\\\\\sum\\\\_{p\\\\\\\\in P}n(q,p)p,\\\\\\\\qquad\\\\\\\\partial(q)\\\\=\\\\\\\\sum\\\\_{p^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\in P^{ \\\\\\\\prime}}n^{\\\\\\\\prime}(q^{\\\\\\\\prime},p^{\\\\\\\\prime})p^{\\\\\\\\prime}]\\n\\nwhere (n(q,p)\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathbb{Z}*{2}) denotes the mod (2\\\\) count of smooth lunes for ((L*{0},L)) from (q) to (p) and (n^{\\\\\\\\prime}(q^{\\\\\\\\prime},p^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathbb{Z}*{2}) denotes the mod (2\\\\) count of smooth lunes for ((L*{0},L^{\\\\\\\\prime})) from (q^{\\\\\\\\prime}) to (p^{\\\\\\\\prime}).

There are two cases, one for a leaf above (L\\\\_{0}) (Case 1\\\\) and one for a leaf below (L\\\\_{0}) (Case 2\\\\), as shown in Figure 8\\\\. In Case 1, let (j\\\\\\\\in{1,\\\\\\\\ldots,2n}) be the index with (\\\\\\\\bar{q}\\\\=s\\\\_{j}) and (\\\\\\\\bar{p}\\\\=s\\\\_{j\\\\+1}). Similarly in case 2, let (j\\\\\\\\in{1,\\\\\\\\ldots,2n}) be the index with (\\\\\\\\bar{p}\\\\=s\\\\_{j}) and (\\\\\\\\bar{q}\\\\=s\\\\_{j\\\\+1}). The intersections point of (L\\\\_{0}) with (L^{\\\\\\\\prime}) are (s\\\\_{1},\\\\\\\\ldots,s\\\\_{j\\\\-1},s\\\\_{j\\\\+2},\\\\\\\\ldots s\\\\_{2n}). For the ordering of the edges of (T(L^{\\\\\\\\prime})) we use the numbering by (1,\\\\\\\\ldots,j\\\\-1,j\\\\+2,\\\\\\\\ldots,2n). Let (k) be the index of the edge adjacent to (w) that lies on the path from (w) to (v). By renumbering if needed, we may arrange that (j\\\\+2\\\\\\\\leq k\\\\\\\\leq 2n). Figure 9 illustrates the change of the graphs in Case 1\\\\. Case 2 is analogous with reversed arrows.\\n\\nLet (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}) and (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}) denote the action functionals for (C) and (C^{\\\\\\\\prime}). Recall that they are defined up to an additive constant.\\n\\n**Lemma 3\\\\.4**.: *After possibly adding an overall constant to (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}), the two action functionals (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}) and (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}) are related as follows: in Case 1*\\n\\n**Lemma 3\\\\.4***After possibly adding an overall constant to (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}), the two action functionals (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}) and (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}) are related as follows: in Case 1*\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\=\\\\\\\\begin{cases}\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\+\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon }{2}\\\\&j\\\\+2\\\\\\\\leq l\\\\\\\\leq k,\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\-\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon}{2}\\\\&\\\\\\\\text{else},\\\\\\\\end{cases}]\\n\\n*and in Case 2*\\n\\n*and in Case 2*\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\=\\\\\\\\begin{cases}\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\-\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+ \\\\\\\\epsilon}{2}\\\\&j\\\\+2\\\\\\\\leq l\\\\\\\\leq k,\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l})\\\\+\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon}{2}\\\\&\\\\\\\\text{else}.\\\\\\\\end{cases}]\\n\\nThe rest of this section is devoted to a proof of this.\\n\\nThere is always a smooth lune between (s\\\\_{i}) and (s\\\\_{i\\\\+1}): To see this, we introduce some notation. Given an edge (e) in (T) we denote by (v(e)) the vertex of the edge that is further away from the root. The subtree (T\\\\_{v}) is the subtree of descendents of the vertex (v). Consider now the edge (e\\\\_{i}) in (T) and the subtree (T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{i})}). The corresponding region in (\\\\\\\\Sigma) is an embedded smooth lune (u^{i}) between (s\\\\_{i}) and (s\\\\_{i\\\\+1}). If (e\\\\_{i}) points away from the root, it is a lune from (s\\\\_{i\\\\+1}) to (s\\\\_{i}). If (e\\\\_{i}) points towards the root, it is a lune from (s\\\\_{i}) to (s\\\\_{i\\\\+1}).\\n\\nFigure 8\\\\. Two scenarios for the leaf.\\nThe smooth lune (u^{i}) has area (W(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{i})})), where (W) denotes the total weight of a weighted tree. From equation (4\\\\) we deduce the following formula for the action difference between two neighboured intersection points:\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\+1})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j})\\\\=s(e\\\\_{j})W(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j})}), \\\\\\\\tag{5}]\\n\\nwhere the sign is determined as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[s(e)\\\\=\\\\\\\\begin{cases}1\\\\&\\\\\\\\text{edge points away from the root}\\\\\\\\ \\\\-1\\\\&\\\\\\\\text{edge points towards the root.}\\\\\\\\end{cases}]\\n\\nUsing this formalism we can now prove Lemma 3\\\\.4\\\\.\\n\\nProof of Lemma 3\\\\.4\\\\.: By Remark 2\\\\.3 it is enough to prove that (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}) defined by the formula in Lemma 3\\\\.4 satisfies (5\\\\) for (T^{\\\\\\\\prime}). We consider Case 1\\\\. First note that (s(e\\\\_{l})\\\\=s(e\\\\_{l}^{\\\\\\\\prime})) for all (l\\\\\\\\neq j,j\\\\+1\\\\). For (l\\\\\\\\notin{j\\\\-1,j,j\\\\+1,k}) we compute\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{l\\\\+1})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{l}) \\\\=\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l\\\\+1})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{l})] \\\\[\\\\=s(e\\\\_{l})W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{l})}\\\\\\\\right)] \\\\[\\\\=s(e\\\\_{l}^{\\\\\\\\prime})W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{l})}^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\right).]\\n\\nFor (l\\\\=j\\\\-1\\\\) first note that (s(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1})\\\\=s(e\\\\_{j\\\\+1})\\\\=s(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1}^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=1\\\\) and as it can be seen from Figure 9 we have\\n\\n\\\\[W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1}^{\\\\\\\\prime})}^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\=W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1})}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\+W \\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j\\\\+1})}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon.]\\n\\nTherefore\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{j\\\\+2})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}^{\\\\\\\\prime}(s\\\\_{j\\\\-1}) \\\\=\\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\+2})\\\\+\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon}{2}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\-\\\\\\\\left( \\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\-1})\\\\-\\\\\\\\frac{a(v)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon}{2}\\\\\\\\right)] \\\\[\\\\=\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\-1})\\\\+\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\+2})\\\\- \\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(s\\\\_{j\\\\+1})\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon] \\\\[\\\\=s(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1})W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1})}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\+s(e\\\\_{j\\\\+1})W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_ {j\\\\+1})}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\+\\\\\\\\epsilon] \\\\[\\\\=s(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1}^{\\\\\\\\prime})W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j\\\\-1}^{\\\\\\\\prime})}^{\\\\\\\\prime} \\\\\\\\right).]\\n\\nSimilarly for (l\\\\=k) we see from Figure 9 that (s(e\\\\_{k})\\\\=s(e\\\\_{k}^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=1\\\\) and\\n\\n\\\\[W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{k}^{\\\\\\\\prime})}^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\=W\\\\\\\\left(T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{k})}\\\\\\\\right)\\\\-a(v)\\\\-\\\\\\\\epsilon.]\\n\\nFigure 9\\\\.

       "  ArxivPaperSection(header='h2', title='4. The shortest bar.', text='The goal of this section is to show Proposition 1\\\\.5\\\\. As in the previous section, we only consider the pair ((L\\\\_{0},L)) for (L\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}*{0}). We assume that (L*{0}) and (L) intersect in at least (2n\\\\\\\\geq 4\\\\) points. Moreover, the action values (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q)), (q\\\\\\\\in L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cap L), are assumed to be distinct. Let (\\\\[a,b)) be the shortest (finite) bar in (\\\\\\\\mathcal{B}(L\\\\_{0},L)) and let (\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}\\\\\\\\in L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cap L) be the intersection points satisfying (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{q})\\\\=b) and (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=a). The goal is to show that there is a leaf from (\\\\\\\\bar{q}) to (\\\\\\\\bar{p}). The proof is based on the following two lemmas whose proofs will be given shortly after.\\n\\n*{0}). We assume that (L***Lemma 4\\\\.1**.: *Let (x,y\\\\\\\\in L*{0}\\\\\\\\cap L) such that (n(x,y)\\\\=1\\\\).

We explain how Proposition 1\\\\.5 follows assuming the previous two lemmas.\\n\\nProof of Proposition 1\\\\.5\\\\.: As a first step towards the proof, we show that (n(\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=1\\\\): Let\\n\\n\\\\[e\\\\=\\\\\\\\bar{q}\\\\+\\\\\\\\sum\\\\_{\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q)\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{q})}n\\\\_{q}q\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathcal{S}]\\nbe the basis element with (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(e)\\\\=b) and\\n\\n\\\\[f\\\\=\\\\\\\\bar{p}\\\\+\\\\\\\\sum\\\\_{\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(p)\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{p})}m\\\\_{p}p\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathcal{S}]\\n\\nbe the basis element with (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(f)\\\\=a). Since (\\\\\\\\partial e\\\\=f), there exists (q^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\in L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cap L) with (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{q})\\\\=b) such that (n(q^{\\\\\\\\prime},\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=1\\\\). By Lemma 4\\\\.1 it follows that (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(q^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{q})). Under the assumption that all the action values are distinct, we conclude that (\\\\\\\\bar{q}\\\\=q^{\\\\\\\\prime}), hence (n(\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=n(q^{\\\\\\\\prime},\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=1\\\\). In particular, there exists a unique smooth lune (u\\\\_{\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}}) from (\\\\\\\\bar{q}) to (\\\\\\\\bar{p}).\\n\\nSuppose by contradiction that the smooth lune (u\\\\_{\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}}) is not a leaf. By Lemma 4\\\\.2, there exists a leaf, say from (x) to (y), whose image is strictly contained in (\\\\\\\\operatorname{Im}(u\\\\_{\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}})). If (n(x,y)\\\\=1\\\\), then the inequality\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x)\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(y)\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{q})\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\bar{p})\\\\=b\\\\-a]\\n\\nis a contradiction to Lemma 4\\\\.1\\\\. If (n(x,y)\\\\=0\\\\), then there are two smooth lunes from (x) to (y), one of them being a leaf. It follows from Lemma 2\\\\.1 that the only possibility for such a situation is when (L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cap L\\\\={x,y}). This is not the case here because there are at least (4\\\\) intersection points. We conclude that (u\\\\_{\\\\\\\\bar{q},\\\\\\\\bar{p}}) is a leaf from (\\\\\\\\bar{q}) to (\\\\\\\\bar{p}). \\n\\nProof of Lemma 4\\\\.1\\\\.: Let (x^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\in L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cap L) be a generator of (CF(L\\\\_{0},L)) satisfying\\n\\n\\\\[\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=\\\\\\\\min{\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\|n(x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime },y)\\\\=1}.]\\n\\nBy minimality of (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})), (\\\\\\\\partial x^{\\\\\\\\prime}) is not a boundary in (\\\\\\\\operatorname{CF}^{\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})}(L\\\\_{0},L)). Hence (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})) is an upper end of a finite bar (\\\\[\\\\\\\\tilde{a},\\\\\\\\tilde{b})). Since (n(x,y)\\\\=1\\\\) one has (\\\\\\\\tilde{b}\\\\=\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x)). Let\\n\\n\\\\[e^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\=x^{\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\+\\\\\\\\sum\\\\_{\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{ \\\\\\\\prime})}l\\\\_{x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime}}x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathcal{S}]\\n\\nbe the basis element with (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(e^{\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\=\\\\\\\\tilde{b}). Then (\\\\\\\\partial e^{\\\\\\\\prime}) contains (y) as a summand because (n(x^{\\\\\\\\prime},y)\\\\=1\\\\), but (n(x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime},y)\\\\=0\\\\) for all (x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime}) with (\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime\\\\\\\\prime})\\\\<\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x^{\\\\\\\\prime})). In particular, (\\\\\\\\tilde{a}\\\\=\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\\\\\partial e)\\\\\\\\geq\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(y)). By minimality of the bar (\\\\[a,b)) it follows that\\n\\n\\\\[b\\\\-a\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\tilde{b}\\\\-\\\\\\\\tilde{a}\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(x)\\\\-\\\\\\\\mathcal{A}(y).]\\n\\nProof of Lemma 4\\\\.2\\\\.: Without loss of generality, we may assume that (u) is a smooth lune from (s\\\\_{1}) to (s\\\\_{l}), (3\\\\\\\\leq l\\\\\\\\leq 2n) with (u(\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\\\\\cap\\\\\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\=\\\\[s\\\\_{1},s\\\\_{l}]). Intuitively, if there were no leaf contained in (\\\\\\\\operatorname{Im}(u)), whenever some part of the graph (T(L)) enters the region of the lune, it will also leave the lune. Entering and leaving happens only on (\\\\[s\\\\_{1},s\\\\_{l}]), along which the two components of the graph alternate. This is not possible.\\n\\nTo make this argument rigorous, let us assume that (\\\\\\\\operatorname{Im}(u)) does not contain any leaf. We denote by (C\\\\_{1}) the upper, and by (C\\\\_{2}) the lower component of (\\\\\\\\Sigma\\\\\\\\backslash L). Consider the preimages (R\\\\_{k}:\\\\=u^{\\\\-1}(C\\\\_{k})\\\\\\\\subset\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}) of (C\\\\_{k}) under (u) for (k\\\\=1,2\\\\). See Figure 10 for an illustration of these sets.\\n\\nThen (R\\\\_{1}\\\\\\\\cap R\\\\_{2}\\\\=\\\\\\\\emptyset). Let (0\\\\=\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{1}\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\cdots\\\\\\\\leq\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{l}\\\\=1\\\\) be the points on (\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\\\\\cap\\\\\\\\mathbb{R}) with (u(\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{i})\\\\=s\\\\_{i}). Then (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{i},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{i\\\\+1}]\\\\\\\\subset\\\\\\\\overline{R\\\\_{1}}) for odd (i) and (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{i},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{i\\\\+1}]\\\\\\\\subset\\\\\\\\overline{R\\\\_{2}}) for even (i). Moreover, (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{1},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{2}]) is in the same connected component of (\\\\\\\\overline{R\\\\_{1}}) as (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{l\\\\-1},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{l}]). We set (j\\\\_{1}\\\\=l\\\\-1\\\\). Note that (j\\\\_{1}\\\\\\\\geq 3\\\\). We claim that there exists (4\\\\\\\\leq j\\\\_{2}\\\\<j\\\\_{1}), such that (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{2},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{3}]) and (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{j\\\\_{2}},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{j\\\\_{2}\\\\+1}]) are in the same connected component of (\\\\\\\\overline{R\\\\_{2}}). If not, consider the connected component (R) of (\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{2},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{3}]) in (\\\\\\\\overline{R\\\\_{2}}). (R\\\\\\\\cap\\\\\\\\partial\\\\\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\=\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{2},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{3}]) because (\\\\\\\\operatorname{Int}(R)\\\\\\\\cap R\\\\_{1}\\\\=\\\\\\\\emptyset). Therefore, (u) restricts to a diffeomorphism from (R) to (u(R)). (\\\\\\\\partial R\\\\\\\\backslash\\\\[\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{2},\\\\\\\\lambda\\\\_{3}]\\\\\\\\subset L) and hence (u(R)) is a region in (\\\\\\\\Sigma\\\\\\\\backslash(L\\\\_{0}\\\\\\\\cup L)) that is bounded by (\\\\[s\\\\_{2},s\\\\_{3}]) and part of (L). Therefore, (u(R)) is exactly the region corresponding to the subtree (T\\\\_{v(e\\\\_{j})}). But then (u(R)) contains a leaf, which contradicts our assumption. We therefore find a (j\\\\_{2}) as claimed.\\n\\nProceeding like this, we obtain an infinite sequence ({j\\\\_{k}}\\\\_{k\\\\\\\\in\\\\\\\\mathbb{N}}) of natural numbers with\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\<j\\\\_{k}\\\\<j\\\\_{k\\\\-1}\\\\<l.]\\n\\nThis is impossible. We conclude that (u) does contain a leaf.\\n\\n', children=[])])"
