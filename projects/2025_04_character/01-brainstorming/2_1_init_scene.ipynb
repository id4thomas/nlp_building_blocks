      "trope_id='t13173' name='LoonyFriendsImproveYourPersonality' explanation='A stiff character learns and grows from unwanted interaction with annoying and eccentric people.\\nThe focus character is a fairly stiff guy (rarely a gal), may be the Only Sane Man, The Comically Serious or a Jerkass of the \"stick up his rear\" type, and often comes across as an Ineffectual Loner. He may not be content with his life, but it\\'s stable, and he probably has a long-term plan for fixing what he thinks is wrong, if he can just get the right breaks. Instead, he is dragged into wacky hijinks by the other characters against his will, making a mess of his life. But implicitly or explicitly, the goal in the story is to make him a better person by putting him through \"horrible\" experiences - or at least ones he considers horrible, in order to show him the brighter side of things.\\nMay involve a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but in most examples, it\\'s an entire cast imposing on the stiff guy\\'s time, money and patience. The Power of Friendship is usually evoked by the end of the story. There may be a montage as the character remembers how things used to be, and how despite how much the other characters irritate them, they have made stiff guy a better person by getting him to take off his Jade-Colored Glasses.\\nContrast Defrosting Ice Queen, an Always Female version, and Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist, who may have a similar personality and equally annoying cohorts, but does not have the Character Development.'\n",
      "trope_id='t20361' name='SilverFox' explanation=\"Age is all in the mind.\\nWell, for some people, anyway. Most of us will likely get grumpy, perverted, or past our prime and will end up trying anything in order to look younger.\\nBut then, there are those who get better as they age; the ones who still qualify for the 'desirable' tag, even when they're grandparents. These men and women have maintained their dashing good looks, class, and sex appeal despite — or because of — their greying hair.\\nThey become a Silver Fox. Or, if they're female, a Silver Vixen.\\nA Silver Fox is an attractive, distinguished older (generally over 40) person, often noted for their sexy silver or white hair along with their good looks and charm. Note that this trope is only applicable to characters that look visibly old—characters who are Older Than They Look and resemble young people despite their age don't count.\\nFor the manga, go here. Not to be confused with either Gray Fox or actual silver foxes. For attractive characters that are literal foxes, see Foxy Vixen.\"\n",
      "trope_id='t29724' name='InterGenerationalFriendship' explanation=\"Two people are good friends. Only, one is about twice, or even three times the other person's age! Considering their differences in life experiences and worldviews, how do they relate? What could they possibly have in common? Assuming this is actually a platonic friendship and not something far more sinister, or for that matter an overtly stated mentoring situation, intergenerational friendships can be pretty weird. As the Real Life section indicates, while not everyone finds older or younger people completely unapproachable, there's still frequently a gap there.\\nThis can take the form of a young adult from one generation befriending someone old enough to be their parent or even grandparent, such as in the comedy Finding Forrester. It can take the form of an adult befriending a misguided or vulnerable youth, as in the French film Leon. Sometimes, the two happen to have more in common than they think, such as having surprisingly similar life experiences. Sometimes the younger generation is more mature, or the older generation is less mature - the latter especially helps writers to dodge away from worrying questions being asked about sexual attraction.\\nAs for how they become friends, it could well be contrived circumstances that bring them together, or a shared life experience. Sometimes it's a teacher trying to help a troubled teen, leading to them becoming close friends. Either way, the situation that leads to their friendship would often be something out of the ordinary, since in real life, people of two widely different age groups generally do not reach out to each other.\\nSadly though, if it's an adult and a child who are friends, in modern stories, expect someone to misinterpret it as being sexual, and violence to possibly result. Sometimes the younger one will have an innocent Precocious Crush on the older one.\\nThis trope does not generally apply if it's a parent-child relation between the two.\\nA subtrope of Odd Friendship. Contrast Age-Gap Romance and May–December Romance, in which there is a generation gap between romantic partners. Sister Trope to Mayfly–December Friendship, which involves friendship between beings of vastly different lifespans.\"\n",
      "trope_id='t19375' name='SavvyGuyEnergeticGirl' explanation=\"This is a potential pairing (platonic or otherwise) between a pragmatic guy and a girl who is very full of energy.\\nThe usual gender stereotype is that guys are stronger and may only care about sex, while girls are soft but nicer/smarter. This averts that stereotype (for the most part at least): the guy is the smart but physically inept one and it seems he got himself the company of a girl who most would have trouble keeping up with in the first place.\\nIn some cases, the girl can be smarter than the guy, but because she's too busy trying to have fun, this is occasional at most. Perhaps this is why she acts as a Morality Pet sometimes. Compare Good Is Dumb, although she's more likely to merely be calling out the savvy guy than be evil in her smart moments.\\nIf the guy and the girl are in a romantic relationship, the girl may also be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. If this girl is living with several savvy guys, she's likely a Nerd Nanny.\\nUnlike the Savvy Girl, the Savvy Guy is usually wittier and more prone to wisecracks, and doesn't give in to his emotions quite as much.\\nIt doesn't even have to be a guy or a girl, either. Many works featuring male x male or female x female romantic relationships will also follow the trope, with one partner being perky and optimistic while the other is savvy and smarter.\\nCompare Perky Female Minion, Uptight Loves Wild, Red Oni, Blue Oni, Strong Girl, Smart Guy, Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy. For another couples trope based on personality, see Brooding Boy, Gentle Girl.\"\n",
