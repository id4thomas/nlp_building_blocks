Despite its discomfort, fear is a crucial signal that prompts protective action and risk assessment\n",

Although challenging, sadness can also foster empathy and pave the way for emotional healing and growth\n",
      "* \"disgust\": Disgust is an aversive emotion that signals rejection toward something perceived as harmful, unclean, or morally offensive. It serves as a protective mechanism, prompting us to avoid substances or situations that might be dangerous. This emotion plays a vital role in maintaining both physical health and ethical boundaries\n",
      "* \"anger\": Anger arises when we perceive injustice, frustration, or a threat to our well-being, often urging us to act in response.

When managed effectively, anger can motivate constructive action and help assert personal boundaries\n",
