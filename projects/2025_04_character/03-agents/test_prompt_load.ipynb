Despite its discomfort, fear is a crucial signal that prompts protective action and risk assessment\n",
      "* \"surprise\": Surprise occurs when we encounter the unexpected, momentarily halting our regular thought process.

It serves as a protective mechanism, prompting us to avoid substances or situations that might be dangerous. This emotion plays a vital role in maintaining both physical health and ethical boundaries\n",
      "* \"anger\": Anger arises when we perceive injustice, frustration, or a threat to our well-being, often urging us to act in response.
